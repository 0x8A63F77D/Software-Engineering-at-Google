**CHAPTER 6**


In Chapter 5, we talked about what it means to go from being an “individual contrib‐ utor” to being an explicit leader of a team. It’s a natural progression to go from lead‐ ing one team to leading a set of related teams, and this chapter talks about how to be effective as you continue along the path of engineering leadership.
在第五章，我们讨论了从独立开发者到一个团队的领导意味着什么。从领导一个团队转变到一系列的相关团队是很自然的过程，这章我们将讨论如何在管理工程团队中持续保持高效。

As your role evolves, all the best practices still apply. You’re still a “servant leader”; you’re just serving a larger group. That said, the scope of problems you’re solving becomes larger and more abstract. You’re gradually forced to become “higher level.” That is, you’re less and less able to get into the technical or engineering details of things, and you’re being pushed to go “broad” rather than “deep.” At every step, this process is frustrating: you mourn the loss of these details, and you come to realize that your prior engineering expertise is becoming less and less relevant to your job. Instead, your effectiveness depends more than ever on your general technical intuition and ability to galvanize engineers to move in good directions.

随着你角色的演进，之前的最佳实践仍适用。你仍然是一个服务型领导；你只不过是开始服务于更大的团队了。这就是说，需要你解决的问题领域更大，更抽象了。你被迫上升到了更高的层层。你越来越不太能接触到具体的技术上的或工程上的细节，被迫地，你需要知道的更“广”，而不是更“深”。这个过程的每一步都令人沮丧：你丧失了对技术细节的掌控，然后渐渐意识到之前的工程经验与你现在的工作的关联性越来越少。你的工作效率变得更加依赖对通用的技术领域的直觉和引导工程师找对正确的前进方向上。

The process is often demoralizing—until one day you notice that you’re actually hav‐ ing much more impact as a leader than you ever had as an individual contributor. It’s a satisfying but bittersweet realization.
So, assuming that we understand the basics of leadership, what it does it take to scale yourself into a really good leader? That’s what we talk about here, using what we call “the three Always of leadership”: Always Be Deciding, Always Be Leaving, Always Be Scaling.

这个过程通常是令人沮丧的 -- 直到有一天你意识到作为一个领导者你比作为独立开发者有多得多的影响力。这是个令人满意的，但是也是喜忧参半的领悟。
至此，假设我们已经知道了领导的本质，那么到底什么才能让你提升为一个真正优秀的管理者呢？这就是我们这里想要讨论的，我们称之为“管理上的三个总是”：总是在决定，总是在放手，总是在扩张。

# 总是在决定

Managing a team of teams means making ever more decisions at ever-higher levels. Your job becomes more about high-level strategy rather than how to solve any spe‐ cific engineering task. At this level, most of the decisions you’ll make are about find‐ ing the correct set of trade-offs.
管理团队组成的团队意味着在更高层面上做决定。你的工作从解决具体的工程任务变成制定更高的策略。在这个层面上，你将做的决策大多数是关于更好地权衡。

## 关于机场的寓言故事

Lindsay Jones is a friend of ours who is a professional theatrical sound designer and composer. He spends his life flying around the United States, hopping from produc‐ tion to production, and he’s full of crazy (and true) stories about air travel. Here’s one of our favorite stories:


Lindsay Jones 是我们的一个专业的戏剧声音设计师和编曲朋友。他一生大部分时间都在美国各地飞来飞去，在不同的产品之间切换。他有很多疯狂（而且真实）的关于航空旅行的故事。以下是我们最喜欢的其中一个：

>It’s 6 a.m., we’re all boarded on the plane and ready to go. The captain comes on the PA system and explains to us that, somehow, someone has overfilled the fuel tank by 10,000 gallons. Now, I’ve flown on planes for a long time, and I didn’t know that such a thing was possible. I mean, if I overfill my car by a gallon, I’m gonna have gas all over my shoes, right?
Well, so anyway, the captain then says that we have two options: we can either wait for the truck to come suck the fuel back out of the plane, which is going to take over an hour, or twenty people have to get off the plane right now to even out the weight.
No one moves.

>现在是早上6点，我们都登机了，飞机马上就要起飞。机长在广播中跟我们解释说，不知怎么的有人给飞机多加了 10,000 加仑汽油。我已经在飞过很久了，从没听说过怎么可能发生这种事。我是说，如果我给汽车多加1加仑的汽油，很可能我的鞋里都会灌满汽油，是吧？
好吧，无论如何，机长说我们有两个选择：要么我们等1个多小时等卡车把多余的汽油吸走，要么请12名乘客下飞机来减轻飞机的重量。没有人下飞机。

>Now, there’s this guy across the aisle from me in first class, and he is absolutely livid. He reminds me of Frank Burns on M*A*S*H; he’s just super indignant and sputtering everywhere, demanding to know who’s responsible. It’s an amazing showcase, it’s like he’s Margaret Dumont in the Marx Brothers movies.
So, he grabs his wallet and pulls out this massive wad of cash! And he’s like “I cannot be late for this meeting!! I will give $40 to any person who gets off this plane right now!”
Sure enough, people take him up on it. He gives out $40 to 20 people (which is $800 in cash, by the way!) and they all leave.
So, now we’re all set and we head out to the runway, and the captain comes back on the PA again. The plane’s computer has stopped working. No one knows why. Now we gotta get towed back to the gate.

>现在，在头等舱里我对吗有一个人，是真的很生气了。他让给我想起了**MASH**里的Frank Burns
